Before drafting the document, could you clarify:

1. **Target Audience**: Should this be aimed at beginners, intermediate, or advanced developers?
2. **Depth of Coverage**: Do you want a high-level overview, a step-by-step guide, or an in-depth technical reference?
3. **Specific Features**: Should the plugin focus on specific ESLint rules, performance optimizations, or TypeScript-specific considerations?
4. **Preferred Structure**: Do you want it structured as a tutorial, best practices guide, or reference documentation?
5. **Examples and Code Snippets**: Should it include practical examples and detailed code snippets?

## Anthony's Answer

The target audience should be an advanced AI who will read this document to generate the plugin, period. It should include both a high-level overview and a step-by-step guide. When you provide technical reference, it should be included in the document instead of simply linked out because the AI may not be able to pull in those resources, but do cite your sources, period. It should focus specifically on ESLint rules, specifically how to create them and how to author a plugin that can be published on NPM, period. And it should take TypeScript-specific considerations into account also, period. The preferred structure is a reference document, as this document is going to be used in order to construct ESLint plugins, period. If there are examples in code snippets that are useful for constructing such a plugin, yes, please include them, period.

Understood. I will create a comprehensive reference document detailing how to write a high-quality, open-source ESLint plugin in TypeScript. This will include a high-level overview, a step-by-step guide on creating and publishing ESLint rules as an NPM package, TypeScript-specific considerations, and embedded technical references. I will provide relevant code snippets where applicable. I'll notify you once the document is ready.
